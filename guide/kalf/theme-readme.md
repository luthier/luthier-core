# Theme Name

[Include screenshot(s) of theme]

# Are there any dependencies?

Specify any Kalf extensions or external dependencies necessary for using the theme.

# Are any modifications necessary to use it?

If there are any special instructions needed to use the theme, list them here
(eg, additional properties in the view classes).

If any view classes where changed (through transparent extension), they must be
listed here (even if the change does not affect use of the views). If any of the
common view templates were replaced, they must be listed here. Changes to the
layout or sub-layout templates do not have to be documented as it is expected
that these will be customized for any given theme.
